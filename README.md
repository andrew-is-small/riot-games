# riot-games
Uses the riot games API to collect data about thousands of league of legends matches.

Recorded over 30 variables for over a thousand silver/gold mmr league of legends matches.

# the code

The main run method can be found [at the bottom of this file](pythonfiles/run.py). This code is not very good, and I plan to revisit the project sometime soon. It simply demonstrates
the capability to interact with the riot games API and collect data from it.

# Other info

This was originally a fun side project for me, as I had to do a presentation on web scraping/apis and thought this would be good practice. 

Since then, I've learned more about data analysis, software architecture, and have matured as a programmer overall. I will probably revisit this project.
